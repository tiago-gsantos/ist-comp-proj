# Comp - project
Project of the Compilers course @ IST - 2024/25

### Objective
Build a compiler for a simple language called UDF using Flex, Bison and C++.

### Notes
This project needs an external library (CDK) provided by our teacher to compile and run which I'm not going to provide here.
Both this library and the project description can be found in the Compiler's [wiki](https://web.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/~david.matos/w/pt/index.php?title=Compiladores/Projecto_de_Compiladores).
